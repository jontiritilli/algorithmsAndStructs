# Algorithmic Javascript Functions and Data Structures

#### This is a personal endeavor to understand the most widely used, and most curious, sorting algorithms and common data structures in the context of Javascript.

### Sorting Algorithms
- [x] Bubble Sort *(to understand the inefficiencies of O(n<sup>2</sup>))*
- [x] Quick Sort *(fastest according to O(n))*
- [x] Pancake Sort *(for fun)*
- [ ] Insertion Sort
- [ ] Merge Sort
- [ ] Radix style sorts
- [ ] Counting Sort and Bucket Sort
- [ ] Heap Sort

### Searches
- [ ] Linear Search
- [ ] Binary Search
- [ ] Depth First Search
- [ ] Breadth First Search

### Data Structures
- [x] Hash Tables
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Lists
- [ ] Graphs
- [ ] Trees
